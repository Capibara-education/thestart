# 🧠 Capibara Education

**Capibara Education** is a little corner of the internet where [@peppybug](https://github.com/peppybug) and friends mess around with code for fun.

Despite the name, there's not much "education" going on here, unless you count learning how *not* to write code.

## 🐾 What This Is

* A chill, private project
* A sandbox for weird ideas and experiments
* A bunch of devs goofing off
* Occasionally something useful (on accident ofc)

## 🚫 What This Isn't

* A structured course
* A serious organization
* Anything resembling a normal dev team

## 🤷 Why "Capibara Education"?

Because capybaras are cool.
